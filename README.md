### What is “WatchMarket”?
WatchMarket is an aggregation and caching service for blockchain market information. 
The main features of it are:
1. **Aggregation**: it standardizes information from different blockchain data providers e.g. Coinmarketcap into a unified format
2. **Caching**: it acts as a caching layer for this information mainly catering to the goal of cost savings as API calls to data providers are expensive
